# Solomon-Ai-Dashboard

This repository contains a small prototype of the Solomon reasoning engine.

## Symbolic Logging

The dashboard includes a symbolic logging system with a real-time log view.
Logs can be exported as JSON or shared via a webhook endpoint.
See `SymbolicLogView` for the UI and `api/share-symbolic-logs.ts` for the share handler.
