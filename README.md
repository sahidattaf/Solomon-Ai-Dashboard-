# Solomon AI Dashboard

## Overview
The Solomon AI Dashboard is an experimental interface for visualizing reasoning principles and AI modules. It aims to make complex chains of thought easier to inspect by presenting them in an interactive dashboard.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Node.js (18+ recommended).
3. Navigate to the `solomon-reasoning-engine` folder and install dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Start your development server or build process (for example `npm run dev` if you have defined that script).

## Vision
This project envisions a workspace where wisdom-inspired reasoning engines can be explored, extended and shared. By combining simple UI components with clear philosophical laws, the dashboard is intended as a platform for experimentation and teaching around AI reasoning patterns.
