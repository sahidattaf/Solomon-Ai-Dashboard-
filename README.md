# Solomon AI Dashboard

This repository contains the source for a minimal React dashboard called the **Solomon Reasoning Engine**. The code lives inside the `solomon-reasoning-engine` folder. It is a small prototype demonstrating how reasoning concepts might be visualised.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   cd solomon-reasoning-engine
   npm install
   ```
2. Run tests (placeholder)
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

More functionality can be added over time as the project evolves.
