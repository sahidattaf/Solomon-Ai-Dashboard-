# Solomon AI Dashboard

This repository hosts an experimental reasoning dashboard built with React and TypeScript. The majority of the source code lives in the `solomon-reasoning-engine` folder.

## Installation

Navigate into the engine directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd solomon-reasoning-engine
npm install
```

## Development

After installing dependencies you can start the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Other standard commands such as `npm run build` or `npm run lint` can also be run from within the same directory if defined in `package.json`.

The `src` folder under `solomon-reasoning-engine` contains the React components and pages used by the dashboard.
