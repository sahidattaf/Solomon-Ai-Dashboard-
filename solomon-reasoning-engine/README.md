# Solomon Reasoning Engine

This package contains a small React dashboard that demonstrates the core ideas of the Solomon AI project. It exposes tabs for viewing reasoning laws, wisdom modules, memory caching and more. The code in `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` lays out the basic UI.

## Getting Started
1. Install Node.js (18+ recommended).
2. Navigate to this folder and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Add your own build or dev script in `package.json` (for example using Vite or Next.js).
4. Run your development server and open the dashboard in a browser.

## Using the Dashboard
The dashboard presents five sections:
- **Law Core** – foundational principles for reasoning.
- **Wisdom Modules** – reasoning patterns such as self‑critique and reflection.
- **Memory Cache** – a placeholder for persistence across sessions.
- **Visual Logic** – a slot for chain‑of‑thought visualizations.
- **Documentation** – links to deeper philosophical and technical notes.

Feel free to extend these sections or swap in your own logic components. The goal is to experiment with reasoning engines in a clear, visual environment.
